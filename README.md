# 2017-Ryerson-Hackathon-Forming-Bonds
This project is a teaching aid designed to assist with introductory chemistry classes. It allows a user to select from several elements in the periodic table. If they select more than 1 element, the program will determine whether a bond is possible between them. It will then determine the type of bond that will be created and deliver that knowledge to the user. Further improvements would include the application containing a larger selection of atoms, as well as more complex molecules with more feedback given to the user.
